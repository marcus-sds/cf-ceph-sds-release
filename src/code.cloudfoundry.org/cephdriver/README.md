Ceph driver for Volman
# Building
Prereqs:
- [go](https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.4.3.darwin-amd64.pkg)
  - [direnv](direnv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install/)

    ```
    mkdir bin
    go install <TBD>
    ```

    # Quality checks
    ## Cyclomatic Complexity
    Note good number for Cyclomatic Complexity is under 9
    ```
    cd volman
    cd ~
    go get github.com/fzipp/gocyclo
    cd -
    gocyclo -top 10 .
    ```
    ## Duplication
    Note good number is 5 for duplicate symbols (somewhere around 5-lines)
    ```
    cd ~
    brew instal pmd
    cd -
    pmd cpd --minimum-tokens 5 --files . --language go --exclude <file path> --format xml

    ```
    ## Unit Tests
    Note: to run tests, you'll need to be in a containing project (eg. diego_release).
    This will set the correct go environment.
    ```
    # one time setup
    cd ~
    go get github.com/onsi/ginkgo/ginkgo
    go get github.com/onsi/gomega
    cd -


    # run tests
    ginkgo -r
    ```
    ## Coverage
    ```
    # install
    c~ 
    go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/cover
    cd -

    # run
    ginkgo -r -cover

    # to see coverage reports in html
    cd id # or any src directory
    go tool cover -html=id.coverprofile
    ```
    Snapshot:
    ```
    # Any coverage holes are due to Test Files, 3rd party code(xstream) or system calls
    # generated with:
    go test -cover ./...
    ```
    View results for a package as HTML:
    ```
    cd <package-dir>
    go tool cover -html=<package>.coverprofile
    ```
